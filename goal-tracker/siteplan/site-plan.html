  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>This site is meant to help people keep track of goals they want to reach. This includes personal goals, school goals, fitness goals, and daily habits. The idea is to give people a simple place where they can add a goal, mark progress, and see how they are doing over time.</p>

  <h3>Audience</h3>
  <p>The audience is anyone who wants to stay organized and remember the goals they made. This includes students, people who are working on fitness, and people who just want to improve something in their life.</p>

  <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
  <p>The site will have a form where the user can add a new goal. The site will then show all their goals in a list they can look through. The user can check off progress or edit a goal. JavaScript will be used to handle the form, store goal data in objects, and show it with loops and array functions like forEach and filter. Conditional checks will help with errors and empty inputs. I will keep the code in modules.</p>
